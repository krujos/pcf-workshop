= Application Log Draining

In this section, you will configure application log draining into a log analysis tool.  We will use the free Papertrail tool, but any tool that supports tcp syslog draining can be used.

== How it Works

. Review the log draining documentation here: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/log-management.html

== Papertrail

. Sign up for a free Papertrail account: https://papertrailapp.com/

. Follow the instructions to set up Papertrail: http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html#papertrail

. Be sure to add your new User Provided Service to your microservice manifest.

. After you have bound and restarted your microservice, perform a few curl requests and ensure logs are draining into Papertrail.

=== Evaluation

. Review the details on log formats: http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#format

. How do you see only logs related to application staging?

. How can you view logs for a specific application instance?

. Why didn't you have to add an application security group rule?

. How would you prevent log draining to an external service?

Note:  The questions above are not included on the quiz.  But try to answer/discuss them anyway...  :)


== Other External Tools

Any tcp syslog compliant log tools can be used with CloudFoundry.  A few popular configurations are:

. Log Insight
. Splunk Enterprise
. Logstash w/ Elastic Search & Kibana
