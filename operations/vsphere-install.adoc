= Installing Pivotal CF on vSphere

== Goal

To install and configure Pivotal CF on vSphere with services.

== Exercise

=== Notes

* The instructor will point to the link:../environments[environment] information.
* Each student should pair up with another to complete the installation.

=== Installing Pivotal CF

. Review the link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/requirements.html[prerequisites] document.
+
* Prerequisites have been verified by the instructors.
* vCenter has been installed and configured.
* A network, datacenter, and cluster have already been created for you.
+

. Follow the guide to link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html[deploying Ops Manager to vSphere]
+
* A jump box has been set up that includes the necessary downloads and the vCenter client.  You can connect to this via Remote Desktop.

* The student VM includes a linux Remote Desktop client called "Remmina".  You can launch it from a terminal window:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ remmina
----
+
* Alternative: link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12[Remote Desktop for Mac]
+

. Log into Ops Manager by going to `https://<internal-ip>` from the JumpBox and creating a user and password.  *Be sure to set the username and password supplied by the instructor*.

=== Configuring Ops Manager Director

. Follow the instructions on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/vsphere-config.html[Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere]
+
* Configuration information is provided by the instructors.
* Because we are resource constrained, we will not be taking advantage of the following: Availability Zones, Multiple Networks, Multiple Datastores.  However, you must still configure each in Ops Manager.
+

. *Director Config*: *Be sure to select the `Enable VM Resurrector Plugin`*.

. *Availability Zones*: Due to resource constraints, we have a single Cluster call `PCF`.  Create a single AZ mapped to this cluster.

. *Networks*: Your vSphere environment is pre-configured with one network due to resource constraints.
+
* `LAN` should be used for both `Infrastructure` and `Deployment`
* Review the link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/network-segmentation.html[Network Segmentation] documentation.
+

. QUESTION: What is the preferred network segmentation strategy?

. Be sure all tabs on the left have a green check mark and that the tile is green on the dashboard before continuing to the next exercise.

. In the interest of time, *DO NOT* click `Apply changes` at this point.  We will first add additional products via Ops Manager (next section).
